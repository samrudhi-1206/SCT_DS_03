## 🤖 Task 03 – ML Model Training & Evaluation

In this task, I trained a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) to predict passenger survival from the Titanic dataset.

### 📌 What I Did:
- Used the **cleaned dataset** from Task 2
- Split data into training and test sets
- Trained a **Logistic Regression model**
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score
- Summarized all metrics in an Excel sheet

### 📊 Accuracy:
**Achieved approx XX.X% accuracy** *(put actual number from your Excel)*

### 📁 Files:
- `task_03.xlsx` – contains model performance metrics

### 📝 Note:
No graphs were created for this task — all metrics are presented in tabular format inside the Excel sheet.
